# TRIVIALPURSUITGAME
Modified Trivial Pursuit–style quiz game built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles and MFC for GUI. Features CSV file handling, dice-based category selection, score tracking, and high-score management.
The TrivialLogic game is a GUI-based quiz application where players answer random questions loaded from CSV files.  
Each category of questions is represented in a separate CSV file, and the user interacts through a dialog-based interface built with MFC.

Players can:
- 🎲 Roll a dice to pick a random question category  
- 💡 Answer multiple-choice questions  
- 🧾 Add or remove questions (admin functions)  
- 🏆 Track high scores via a CSV file  
- ❤️ Manage lives and points through gameplay  

The game logic, file operations, and GUI components are modularized using C++ classes.
